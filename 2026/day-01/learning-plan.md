# 90 Days of DevOps - Learning Plan

## 1. The "Why" (My Intent)
I am starting this challenge to transition from a traditional Linux System Administrator role to a modern DevOps Engineering role. My goal is to bridge the gap between my existing server management skills and modern cloud-native practices (CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Automation) to increase my career value and technical capability.

## 2. The Goals (Next 90 Days)
1.  **Deploy a Production-Grade App:** End-to-end deployment of a microservices app on Kubernetes with full monitoring.
2.  **Master Infrastructure as Code:** Move from manual server configuration to using Terraform and Ansible for all deployments.
3.  **Build a Portfolio:** Document every major project on GitHub to demonstrate skills to future employers.

## 3. Core Skills to Build
* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Jenkins & GitHub Actions (Automating the build/test/deploy process).
* **Container Orchestration:** Docker & Kubernetes (Deep dive into clustering and scaling).
* **Cloud Automation:** AWS & Terraform (Provisioning infrastructure via code).

## 4. Weekly Time Budget & Consistency

* **Strategy:** "Consistency over Intensity."
* **Weekdays:** 2 Hours (1 hour theory + 1 hour lab) – Early Morning or Late Night.
* **Weekends:** 4-5 Hours (Deep dive labs and project work).
* **Accountability:** I will push code to GitHub daily and share progress.
